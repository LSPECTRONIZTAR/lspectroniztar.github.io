# How I Became a Coder: The Full Story
When you hear the name “lspectroniztar” (if you even know someone with such a weird name¹), you might think of this weird YouTuber that posts stupid gaming content on a channel that was intended for game development². You might think of this kid that is always misunderstood online because people keep getting the wrong ideas. You might even think of this somewhat arrogant Scratcher that also happens to be “criminally underrated”.

Now, for those of you who are unfamiliar with the term “Scratcher”, let me give you a short description; it’s basically someone that uses Scratch on a regular basis. And if you don’t know what Scratch is, it’s “a free programming language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations”⁴. In short, it’s a Blockly coding website.

“Blockly coding is just putting blocks together. Anyone can put blocks together.” Yeah, right. Coding is much more than that. Coding is how you express your imagination and creativity. Coding is the technique that created TikTok and YouTube and Instagram and all those other social media platforms you use (and yes, none of them might have been made using a block-coding language, but still!). Coding is how I created this website in the first place (yes, this website was made using PenguinMod, a mod of a mod of Scratch). Coding is what made me… well, me. I’ve always loved coding for as long as I can remember, but I’ve never told anyone how I truly became interested in this ancient art of “just putting blocks together” that is known to many as “block-coding”. So you’ll be the first of many⁵ to hear about my legendary story!

² I no longer post gaming content on my main channel (well, not for the most part), but on a separate channel.

⁵ Okay, maybe not the first of many. I forgot to program a counter that displays how many people found this website.
